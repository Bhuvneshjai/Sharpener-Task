Ques-1. Explain how does the internet work in your own words.
-> The internet is like a vast network of connected computers. When you request a website, 
your device sends a message to a server. The server processes your request, retrieves the webpage's data, 
and sends it back to your device. This communication happens via a series of interconnected 
routers and data centers, allowing information to flow globally.

Ques-2. What are the core modules of node js?
-> Node.js has essential core modules, including:
    fs (File System): For file operations.
    http: To create web servers.
    url: To parse and format URLs.
    path: For handling file paths.
    events: To manage event-driven programming.
    util: Providing utility functions.
    os: Offering operating system-related information.
    crypto: For cryptographic operations.
    stream: Handling streaming data.

Ques-3. Explain the use of each one of them in detail.
-> fs (File System): Used to read, write, and manipulate files on the server or file system.
    http: Facilitates creating web servers and handling HTTP requests and responses.
    url: Allows parsing and formatting URLs for working with web addresses.
    path: Used for handling file and directory paths, making path-related operations cross-platform.
    events: Enables event-driven programming with custom event emitters.
    util: Provides utility functions for debugging and formatting.
    os: Offers information about the operating system, including CPU and memory.
    crypto: Supports cryptographic operations like hashing, encryption, and decryption.
    stream: Handles streaming data, making it efficient for reading and writing large files or data.

Ques-4. What are relative path and absolute path ?
-> A relative path specifies a file or directory location in relation to the current working directory. 
    An absolute path provides the full path from the root directory. In Windows, an absolute path starts with
    a drive letter (e.g., C:) or a network share (e.g., \server\share). In Unix-based systems, an absolute 
    path starts with a forward slash (/). To define them, you specify the path to a file or directory
    within the context of your file system.

Ques-5. What does createServer do ?
-> The createServer function in Node.js is used to create an HTTP server. It takes a callback function 
    as an argument, which is executed for each incoming HTTP request. This function allows you to define how
    the server responds to requests, making it a fundamental component for building web applications and APIs.

Ques-6. What are anonymous functions ?
-> Anonymous functions, often called "unnamed" or "inline" functions, are functions without a specific name. 
    They are defined on the spot, typically used for short, one-time operations. These functions are 
    useful when you don't need to reuse the code and can be declared directly where they're needed.

Ques-7. What do you think server.listens exactly do?Why do we need it ?
-> server.listen in Node.js starts a server to listen for incoming network connections. It binds the server 
    to a specific port and IP address, waiting for client requests. It's essential to specify where and 
    how the server should listen, allowing it to handle incoming requests and respond to clients appropriately.
